Application made during HuskieHack as a response to a challenge posed by DeKalb Community Gardens for Volunteer Registration and informations for weeding. The App takes in informations from the user if he/she wishes to volunteer for serving in the DeKalb Community Gardens. The information entered by the user is stored on an online spreadsheet in Google forms and forms a pseudo cloud database. The Volunteers are also offered options to know about the various weeds that grow in these community gardens and which is also the main subject around which volunteering would revolve. The app would also provide information about the various locations of the gardens in which the volunteers can work and also navigate their way to the particular location through the usage of the Google Maps API.
